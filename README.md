## _CuidaPet_

This Flutter project is under development, the lessons for this project were recorded in Flutter 2 and Modular v3, but this project is in Flutter 3 and Modular v6.

To start this project, it will be necessary to run the server (cuidapet_api) and utilize the FlutterFire CLI/Firebase Console to generate the files:

- firebase.json
- lib/firebase_options.dart
- android/app/google-services.json

Create a .env file at the root of the project with the following information:

```sh
base_url=http://YOUR_IP:8080
rest_client_connect_timeout=60000
rest_client_receive_timeout=60000
google_api_key=YUOR_KEY
```

## SECURITY FAILURES

> all keys have already been invalidated
> and the files have been cleaned,
> leaving only a note.

## NOTES

This project was started and recorded in Flutter 2 and Modular v3, but it is being developed by me in Flutter v3 and Modular v6, in its first versions it may offer errors, but all my effort is focused on adapting and solving them.

You may find some unnecessary files in this project, just ignore it may be a note.
